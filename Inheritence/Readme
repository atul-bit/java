## 🔍 What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It allows one class (child/subclass) to **inherit** properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from another class (parent/superclass).

Inheritence creates "is" type of relationship.

> ✅ Inheritance promotes code reuse and supports polymorphism.

## 📊 Types of Inheritance in Java

Java supports the following types of inheritance:

1. **Single Inheritance**
    When a single class inherites from one single class.

2. **Multilevel Inheritance**
    When a class inherits from another class, and that class inherits from other class, thus forms a chain.
    This chain of inherittence is called as multilevel inheritence.

3. **Hierarchical Inheritance**
    When multiple classes inherits from a single class file, is called Hierarchical inheritence.

4. **Hybrid(multiple) Inheritance** (via interfaces)
    When a single class tries to inherit from two class file, is called multiple inheritence.
    Java does not supports multiple inheritence because it becomes difficult to choose between same method of different class.
