Welcome to the world of Java!!!

public static void main (String[] args)

1. public -> can be called from anywhere i.e. jvm can called the method from anywhere.

2. static -> can be invoked without creating the object of the class

3. void -> does not returns anything

4. main -> entry point of thew code execution that jvm looks

5. String[] args -> allows users to pass command-line arguments to the program.
like java hello.java atul -> here atul is passed like an argument.
